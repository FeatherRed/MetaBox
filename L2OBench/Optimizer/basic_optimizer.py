This is the basic optimizer class. All traditional optimizers should inherit from this class.
Your own traditional should have the following functions:
    1. __init__(self, problem, config) to initialize the optimizer
    2. train(self) to train the optimizer
    3. get_best(self) to get the best solution
    4. update(self) to update the optimizer after each batch
